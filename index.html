            Hey! Welcome to my page I’m glad we’ve made it this far and hope to work with you in the near future.
             I’m sure you go through dozens of these a day, I’ll keep this one short and sweet. So, here’s a little
              about myself. I’m currently 27 years old, born and raised in Queens NY. At the ripe age of 6 years old
               I started practicing martial arts, and never really stopped after that. I love to eat, so if you need
                someone to checkout that new restaurant with you, I’m your guy! I’m also lucky to be a married man 
                and father to my two beautiful children.
            <br>Now to showcase my work ethic! I have been working since I was 16 years old as a plumber and climbed that ladder for a while, eventually making it to a union where a lot of opportunities presented themselves. With my first child on the way I started working for a small family business. I wore many hats; I would do estimates, supervise jobs, and attend meetings. But what does this have to do with programming? I believe I hold skills that are essential to a well-rounded programmer. I communicate well, love to learn new things and have a positive attitude. I’ll be the first to admit that I do not know everything, but I can guarantee a product we both can be proud of. 

        </p>
