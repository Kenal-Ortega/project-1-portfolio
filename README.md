## Project Description
My project will be a landing page about me for potential employers. It will include an about me, contact information and, previous work experience. I’ve looked over some sites to use as reference and I really liked this one https://dietoself86.github.io/project-1-portfolio/. I’m not sure if my project will resemble this, but I will be going for that clean-cut look, especially since I don’t think I have much to put on the page.
